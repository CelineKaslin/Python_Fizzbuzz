# Python-Fizzbuzz #

FizzBuzz challenge.<br/>
The program is doing as following :<br/>

* The program can be passed a number
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
* In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

## How to use ##

1. clone the repo<br/>
Under the repo name click *clone or download*<br/>

Click on *use HTTPs*, copy the clone URL of the repo<br/>
In the terminal go on the working directory where you want the cloned directory to be<br/>
Use the `git clone` command and paste the clone URL then press enter :

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repositary.git
```

2. On your local machine go inside of the *Python_Fizzbuzz* directory :

```shell
$ cd Python_Fizzbuzz
```
3. You can see the *.py* file where the code is by using the `ls` command :

```shell
$ ls
```

4. You can open the *.py* file and change the code in your text editor or using `vim` :

```shell
$ vim file_name.py
```
Or you can just read the contains of it from the command line with `cat` :

```shell
$ cat file_name.py
```

## Run the program ##

1. Open the *.py* in your editor or in `vim`.

2. Call the function passing a number of your choice as parameter.<br/>
*fizzbuzz(5)* for example.<br/>
To display the output of this call, add a `print` in front of the function called with a given number : *print fizzbuzz(5)*.

3. To see the result of the function called with the given number displayed on the command line, go on the command line from the root directory of the challenge and use the command `python file_name.py`.

```shell
$ python fizzbuzz.py
```
4. You can repeat the steps *2* and *3* as much as you want to test the program with different numbers.
